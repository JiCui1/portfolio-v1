              <p className="">I&apos;m Ji, a fullstack developer at <a href="https://brainboxlabs.com" target="_blank">Brain Box Labs</a> in Toronto üá®üá¶ .</p>
              <p className="">I graduated with a BSc degree in <strong>Mechanical Engineering</strong> from  Ontario Tech University. After working as a Mechanical Engineer for 2 years, I decided to transition into software because all the cool things happening on this side so I did a Interactive Media Design and Web Development program from Durham College.</p>
              <p className="">My tech stack at work is <strong>Vue, Nuxt, Typescript, Inertia, Vite</strong> for front-end and <strong>Laravel, MySQL</strong> for backend. While for my personal projects, I tend to use <strong>Next.js, Go, Ruby on Rails, Bun, Docker, Postgres or serverless with AWS</strong> or any cool stuff (<a href="https://turso.tech" target="_blank">Turso</a> is looking pretty interesting now ü§î) that I don&apos;t get to use at work.</p>
              <p className="">Other than the regular web dev things, I also dabble into a lof of AI stuff and got an <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> certificate from University of Toronto. In my free time, I usually play with <strong>Neural Nets, Ollama, HuggingFace, PyTorch, AI agents and Evals.</strong></p>
              <p className="">My dev setup is <strong>Kitty Terminal, Tmux, Neovim, Fish shell.</strong></p>
              <p className="">My life outside of coding tho (I do have one lol), you generally can catch me playing <strong>basketball üèÄ</strong> with the boys. I also play <strong>badminton üè∏</strong> on and off. In the summer/fall, I do a lot of <strong>hiking</strong> as well in the cool national parks nearby. And also a big fan of <strong>travelling</strong>, been to 20+ countries at this point.</p>
